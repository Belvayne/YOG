 * CRAZY PHYSICS SETUP GUIDE
 * =========================
 * 
 * This guide will help you set up crazy physics reactions for your enemies
 * when they get hit by bullets - no ragdoll needed!
 * 
 * STEP 1: ENEMY SETUP
 * -------------------
 * 1. Select your SSRB enemy model in the scene
 * 2. Add the CrazyPhysicsSetup script to the root GameObject
 * 3. Click "Setup Crazy Physics" in the inspector (or right-click component)
 * 4. This will automatically add:
 *    - CrazyPhysicsController
 *    - SimpleEnemyHealth
 *    - Bouncy physics material (if created)
 * 
 * STEP 2: CONFIGURE CRAZY PHYSICS
 * -------------------------------
 * On the CrazyPhysicsController component:
 * 
 * Force Settings:
 * - baseForceMultiplier: Overall force strength (1.0 = normal, 2.0 = double)
 * - explosionForce: How strong the explosion effect is
 * - explosionRadius: How far the explosion effect reaches
 * - upwardForce: How much upward force is applied
 * - spinForce: How much spinning force is applied
 * - bounceForce: How much bouncing force is applied
 * 
 * Force Types (check what you want):
 * - useExplosionForce: Creates explosion effect at impact point
 * - useUpwardForce: Launches enemy upward
 * - useSpinForce: Makes enemy spin wildly
 * - useBounceForce: Makes enemy bounce off surfaces
 * - useRandomForces: Adds random chaotic forces
 * 
 * STEP 3: CONFIGURE HEALTH
 * ------------------------
 * On the SimpleEnemyHealth component:
 * - maxHealth: How much damage enemy can take
 * - enableCrazyPhysicsOnDamage: Apply crazy physics when hit
 * - enableCrazyPhysicsOnDeath: Apply extra crazy physics when dying
 * - deathForceMultiplier: Extra force multiplier when enemy dies
 * 
 * STEP 4: ADD EFFECTS (OPTIONAL)
 * ------------------------------
 * Visual Effects:
 * - impactEffect: Particle system for impact effects
 * - explosionPrefab: GameObject to spawn on impact
 * - effectLifetime: How long effects last
 * 
 * Audio Effects:
 * - impactSounds: Array of sounds to play on impact
 * - explosionSound: Sound for explosion effect
 * - volume: Audio volume
 * 
 * STEP 5: PHYSICS MATERIAL
 * ------------------------
 * For extra bouncy behavior:
 * 1. Click "Create Bouncy Material" in CrazyPhysicsSetup
 * 2. This creates a bouncy physics material
 * 3. The setup will automatically apply it to your enemy
 * 
 * STEP 6: TESTING
 * ---------------
 * 1. Click "Test Crazy Physics" in the inspector
 * 2. Your enemy should fly around with crazy physics
 * 3. Shoot your enemy with bullets to see the real effect
 * 4. Adjust force settings until you get the desired craziness
 * 
 * TUNING TIPS:
 * ------------
 * For more chaos:
 * - Increase baseForceMultiplier (1.5-3.0)
 * - Increase explosionForce and explosionRadius
 * - Enable all force types
 * - Use bouncy physics material
 * 
 * For less chaos:
 * - Decrease baseForceMultiplier (0.5-1.0)
 * - Disable some force types
 * - Use normal physics material
 * 
 * For specific effects:
 * - Want spinning? Increase spinForce
 * - Want bouncing? Increase bounceForce, use bouncy material
 * - Want explosions? Increase explosionForce and radius
 * - Want random chaos? Enable useRandomForces
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE:
 * ------------
 * - Crazy physics is lightweight compared to ragdoll
 * - Effects are temporary and self-cleanup
 * - Can handle many enemies at once
 * - Adjust randomForceCount if performance issues
 * 
 * TROUBLESHOOTING:
 * ----------------
 * - Enemy not moving? Check if Rigidbody is present
 * - Too tame? Increase force multipliers
 * - Too crazy? Decrease force multipliers
 * - No effects? Check if impactEffect/explosionPrefab are assigned
 * - No sound? Check if audioSource and sounds are assigned
