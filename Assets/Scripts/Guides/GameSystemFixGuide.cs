 * GAME SYSTEM FIX GUIDE
 * =====================
 * 
 * This guide covers the fixes applied to resolve the reported issues:
 * 1. Kill count UI not updating
 * 2. Game not ending when 10 kills reached
 * 3. Main menu not reacting to inputs
 * 4. Settings button removal
 * 
 * FIXES APPLIED:
 * ==============
 * 
 * 1. KILL COUNT UI FIX:
 * ---------------------
 * - Updated GameUI.UpdateKillCounterUI() to better find KillCounter
 * - Added fallback to FindObjectOfType<KillCounter>() if Instance is null
 * - This ensures the UI updates even if KillCounter singleton isn't initialized
 * 
 * 2. GAME ENDING FIX:
 * -------------------
 * - Updated LevelManager to automatically start game when scene loads
 * - Removed the commented out StartGame() call
 * - This ensures the game starts properly and kill counter events are connected
 * 
 * 3. MAIN MENU INPUT FIX:
 * -----------------------
 * - Added SetupButtonListeners() method to MainMenuUISetup
 * - Properly connects button onClick events to MainMenuManager methods
 * - This ensures buttons actually work when clicked
 * 
 * 4. SETTINGS BUTTON REMOVAL:
 * ---------------------------
 * - Removed settingsButton from MainMenuManager
 * - Removed settings button creation from MainMenuUISetup
 * - Removed OpenSettings() method
 * - Moved quit button up to fill the space
 * 
 * HOW TO SETUP:
 * =============
 * 
 * 1. MAIN MENU SCENE:
 *    - Create empty GameObject called "MainMenuManager"
 *    - Add MainMenuUISetup script
 *    - Click "Setup Main Menu UI" in inspector
 *    - This creates a working main menu with proper button listeners
 * 
 * 2. GAME SCENE:
 *    - Add all your game objects (player, enemies, etc.)
 *    - Add KillCounter GameObject with KillCounter script
 *    - Add LevelManager GameObject with LevelManager script
 *    - Add GameUI GameObject with GameUI script
 *    - Connect UI references in GameUI inspector
 * 
 * 3. BUILD SETTINGS:
 *    - Add MainMenu scene (index 0)
 *    - Add GameScene (index 1)
 * 
 * EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
 * ==================
 * 
 * Main Menu:
 * - Shows blank screen with main menu
 * - Start Game button loads GameScene
 * - Quit Game button exits application
 * - No settings button (removed as requested)
 * 
 * Game Scene:
 * - Starts automatically when loaded
 * - Kill counter UI updates in real-time
 * - Game ends when 10 kills reached
 * - Shows level complete screen
 * - Returns to main menu
 * 
 * TROUBLESHOOTING:
 * ===============
 * 
 * Kill counter not updating?
 * - Check if KillCounter script is attached to a GameObject in GameScene
 * - Verify GameUI has kill count UI elements assigned
 * - Check console for "Kill added!" messages
 * 
 * Game not ending?
 * - Check if LevelManager is in the GameScene
 * - Verify KillCounter target is set to 10
 * - Check if OnLevelComplete event is connected
 * 
 * Main menu buttons not working?
 * - Check if MainMenuUISetup ran successfully
 * - Verify button listeners are set up
 * - Check console for "Button listeners setup complete!" message
 * 
 * Scene not loading?
 * - Check if scenes are added to Build Settings
 * - Verify scene names match exactly ("MainMenu", "GameScene")
 * - Check console for loading errors
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE NOTES:
 * =================
 * 
 * - Kill counter now has better error handling
 * - UI updates are more reliable
 * - Button listeners are properly managed
 * - Scene transitions are smoother
 * 
 * CUSTOMIZATION:
 * ==============
 * 
 * Kill Target:
 * - Change targetKills in KillCounter or LevelManager
 * - Default is 10 kills
 * 
 * UI Appearance:
 * - Modify colors and fonts in MainMenuUISetup
 * - Adjust button positions and sizes
 * - Add background images or effects
 * 
 * Game Flow:
 * - Modify LevelManager for different end conditions
 * - Add multiple levels or difficulty settings
 * - Customize level complete behavior
