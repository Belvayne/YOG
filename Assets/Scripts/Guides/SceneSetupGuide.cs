 * SCENE SYSTEM SETUP GUIDE
 * ========================
 * 
 * This guide will help you set up a proper scene system with a main menu
 * and separate game scene for your YOG game.
 * 
 * STEP 1: CREATE SCENES
 * ---------------------
 * 
 * Main Menu Scene:
 * 1. Create a new scene called "MainMenu"
 * 2. Save it in your Scenes folder
 * 3. This scene will only contain the main menu UI
 * 
 * Game Scene:
 * 1. Create a new scene called "GameScene" 
 * 2. Save it in your Scenes folder
 * 3. This scene will contain all your game elements (player, enemies, etc.)
 * 
 * STEP 2: SETUP MAIN MENU SCENE
 * -----------------------------
 * 
 * 1. Open the MainMenu scene
 * 2. Create an empty GameObject called "MainMenuManager"
 * 3. Add the MainMenuUISetup script to it
 * 4. Click "Setup Main Menu UI" in the inspector
 * 5. This will create a complete main menu automatically
 * 
 * Optional: Add SceneLoader to MainMenu scene:
 * 1. Create empty GameObject called "SceneLoader"
 * 2. Add the SceneLoader script to it
 * 3. This enables loading screens and smooth transitions
 * 
 * STEP 3: SETUP GAME SCENE
 * ------------------------
 * 
 * 1. Open the GameScene
 * 2. Add all your game elements:
 *    - Player with PlayerMovement and PlayerShooting
 *    - EnemySpawner
 *    - KillCounter
 *    - LevelManager
 *    - GameUI (your HUD)
 *    - Ground/level geometry
 *    - Lighting
 * 3. Remove any main menu elements from this scene
 * 
 * STEP 4: CONFIGURE BUILD SETTINGS
 * --------------------------------
 * 
 * 1. Go to File > Build Settings
 * 2. Add both scenes to the build:
 *    - MainMenu (index 0)
 *    - GameScene (index 1)
 * 3. Make sure MainMenu is at index 0 (it will load first)
 * 
 * STEP 5: TEST THE SYSTEM
 * -----------------------
 * 
 * 1. Play the MainMenu scene
 * 2. You should see a blank screen with main menu
 * 3. Click "Start Game"
 * 4. The GameScene should load
 * 5. Test all functionality in the game scene
 * 
 * SCENE FLOW:
 * -----------
 * 
 * MainMenu Scene → Start Game → GameScene
 * GameScene → Game Over → MainMenu Scene
 * GameScene → Level Complete → MainMenu Scene
 * GameScene → Pause → MainMenu Scene
 * 
 * ADVANCED FEATURES:
 * -----------------
